#Fwum

A modern compiled language

Fwum aims to be a compiled language that fills a niche mostly left to scripting languages- rapid iterative development. Compiling in many languages, especially C++, is famously slow. Debugging in C and C++ requires paging through stacktraces or using a debugger to find a null dereference. The goal of Fwum is to make learning the language easy, setting up the development environment easy, the act of writing Fwum fast and simple, and mainting Fwum as painless as possible.
