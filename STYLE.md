#Code Style
All code in Fwum should be formatted according to this style

- All braces should be on the same line as the if, function, for, while, etc. that they start

- There should be a space between an operator and an operand, except for unary operators, the dot operator, and the pointer operator

- Pointers should be declared as `type *name`

- Null checks should be `if(name == NULL)` to keep clarity
