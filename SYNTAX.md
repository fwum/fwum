#Syntax
##Safer than C, Simpler than Rust
The language forgoes symbols in favor of short words, which are much easier to understand. (eg deref instead of \*, ptr instead of \* for types and \& for variables)

##Be as fast as C or C++
The syntax can be quickly converted into an AST, allowing faster compile times.
